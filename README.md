# Planning Centre API thing

As of right now, it gets the plan for the day and outputs the songs in the service order.

Eventually I would like to create a plugin for GrandMA3 that can pull the songs from planning centre and find the song sequences and assign them to faders.

## If you want to try this
1. Get your planning centre API secret and client id (I have indicated where to put them in the file)
2. Install lua and any dependencies

I think that will work? I don't often do this so idk if it will work for others :)
